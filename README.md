# Census-proj
This project will contain some code used to do some basic analaysis of the 2011 and 2021 census data from 
custom Statscan tabulations. The data contains labour force and employment characteristics,
data on educational attainment, gender, and place of birth. The data is aggregate, making full tidying difficult.
